                            <p>The premise of this project was to build a database management system.
                            It was completed over the period of three months in C++ with a partner for 
                            a databases course taken at SFU. The base idea of the project is to manage
                            database tables (denoted as pages), which includes modification,
                            removal, and addition of tables, and records within tables.
                            A basic benchmarking system displays the speeds Some features of 
                            this project include the following:</p>

                                File Abstraction: contains basic definition and implementation of a page.<br/>
                                Buffer Manager: manages tables within the database.<br/>
                                Skip List: efficient data structure used to store records.<br/>
                                Lock Manager: structure of locks which can be acquired by transactions, allowing for concurrency.<br/>
                                Log: keeps records of all transactions containing how and when it modified the database.<br/>
                                User Functions: ability to insert, read, delete, and update specified records.<br/>
                                Benchmarking: contains statistics on the speed of the engine, primarily measure by commits and aborts per second. </br>

                            <p>In this project, I worked with two others in effort to perform analyses on
                                Yelp business data, specifically, restaurants. The project was done using
                                Python and PySpark over the course of a few weeks. I went through the classical
                                data science process, that is, obtain the data, clean the data, perform operations
                                on the data, and present the data.

                            <p>This project involved a fusion of front and back end technologies. Though the prime focus
                                was databases, an interface was still required to be developed. It was completed with
                                one other member over about two weeks. The program was designed using JavaScript and PostgreSQL.
                                The way that this program works is that it displays options to the user regarding information
                                and operations they would like to receive or perform on a database of grant proposals, reviewers,
                                and meetings.

                                Database design improvements: a database was given, but it lacked some information, and contained errors. This was fixed through database definition modification.</br>
                                Data insertion: information was required to be inserted into the database, which also aided testing.</br>
                                Queries: queries were written in PostgreSQL which would perform numerous operations on the database.</br>
                                Interface: Node.js was used to create the command-line interface.</br>
                                Front & back-end fusion: allowed the front-end to interact with the back-end through JavaScript packages "Prompts" and "Clients".</br>
                                Instructions & presentation: outlined how to set the program up and described how to use it in a report.</br>
