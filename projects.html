                            <p>The premise of this project was to build a database management system.
                            It was completed over the period of three months in C++ with a partner for 
                            a databases course taken at SFU. The base idea of the project is to manage
                            database tables (denoted as pages), which includes modification,
                            removal, and addition of tables, and records within tables.

                            this project include the following:</p>

                            <p>The goal of this project was to solve sudoku instances as efficiently as possible.
                                I coded this over about two weeks in Python. The algorithm used was a popular logical algorithm
                                called DPLL. The algorithm uses a few heuristics to speed up the solving process which 
                                resulted in a tremendous difference. The algorithm will either print 'SAT' when it solves the
                                sudoku instance, or 'UNSAT' if the puzzle is not solvable. Each sudoku puzzle is represented
                                by a set of clauses which are in conjuctive normal form.

                                Unit clause heuristic: a unit clause is a clause which contains one variable. This variable must be set so that this clause is true, so we can set other instances of this variable to this value and speed up the search significantly.<br>

                            <p>This website was made in a team of five as a project for my software engineering
                                course. I was appointed as the group leader. 
                                The premise of the website was to build a dating platform exclusively for
                                SFU students. People who wanted to sign up were required to enter their SFU IDs
                                in order to regsiter for the website, so this would ensure that solely SFU students
                                would use the platform. The site was built with the Ruby on Rails framework and the
                                Scrum software engineering methodology.

                            <p>The purpose of this project was to redesign a mobile app called Canvas, a popular
                                app for students, through UX principles. My group and I redesigned the app using
                                Figma and also created prototypes and explanations for each change we made. Detailed 
                                explanations are given within the documents at the GitHub link.
