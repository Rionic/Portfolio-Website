                            <p>The premise of this project was to build a database management system.
                            It was completed over the period of three months with a partner for 
                            a databases course taken at SFU. The base idea of the project is to manage
                            database tables (denoted as pages), which includes modification,
                            removal, and addition of tables, and records within tables.
                            A basic benchmarking system displays the speeds Some features of 
                            this project include the following:</p>

                                File Abstraction: contains basic definition and implementation of a page.<br/>
                                Buffer Manager: manages tables within the database.<br/>
                                Skip List: efficient data structure used to store records.<br/>
                                Lock Manager: structure of locks which can be acquired by transactions, allowing for concurrency.<br/>
                                Log: keeps records of all transactions containing how and when it modified the database.<br/>
                                User Functions: ability to insert, read, delete, and update specified records.<br/>
                                Benchmarking: contains statistics on the speed of the engine, primarily measure by commits and aborts per second. </br>
